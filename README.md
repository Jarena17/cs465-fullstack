CS-465 Full Stack Development with MEAN

In this full-stack project, a combination of frontend technologies was implemented such as, Express HTML, JavaScript, and a single-page application approach. Express HTML enabled dynamic generation of HTML content on the server-side, which deliver pages to the clientâ€™s browser. Java Script enhanced user interactivity and requests to the backend server. SPA allowed users to seamlessly navigate within the application without any interruptions of full page reloads. The decision of using a NoSQL MongoDB database was because MongoDB is a NoSQL database that offers a flexible schema design, allowing for easy storage and retrieval of JSON-like documents.   

JavaScript is commonly used in web development for creating dynamic and interactive content on the client-side. It runs within the browser and allows for manipulation of HTML, CSS, and DOM elements. JavaScript can handle user interactions, perform calculations, and make asynchronous requests to servers to retrieve or send data. Whereas,  JSON serves as a common format for exchanging data between the frontend and backend of a web application.

A full-stack application, methods, endpoints, and security form the backbone of communication between the frontend and backend components. Methods used are GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE. Endpoints allow access to these resources or functionalities. Security, such as authentication, authorization, encryption, and input validation are implemented at the endpoints to prevent any security breaches.
